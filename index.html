  <p class="welcome-intro">
    <strong>A sanctuary</strong> where healing becomes action, and connection becomes transformation.
  </p>

  <p class="welcome-body">
    Here, <strong>we rise</strong>—from struggle to strength, from surviving to giving.
    The Gift of Hope Community is a place where <strong>your story matters</strong>,
    <strong>your energy is honored</strong>, and <strong>your presence helps others rise</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="welcome-body">
    Whether you've come here with <strong>questions</strong>, <strong>dreams</strong>, or quiet hope,
    <strong>you are not alone</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="welcome-body">
    This is a space where <strong>generosity becomes a ripple</strong>, and every act of kindness
    plants a <strong>seed of abundance</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="welcome-body">
    You are invited to <strong>give</strong>, <strong>receive</strong>, and <strong>grow—together</strong>.

<div class="vision-text">
  <p><strong>Since the very beginning</strong>, we learned that everything is polarized between two energy concepts: <strong>Positive Energy</strong> and <strong>Negative Energy</strong>.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Your energy impacts others</strong>—through your emotional presence, your thoughts, and your actions. Sometimes, <strong>your energy speaks louder than words</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>When you shift your energy toward <strong>positivity</strong>, you surround yourself with <strong>light</strong>. <strong>Uplifting others</strong> is the most powerful way to increase <strong>positive energy flow</strong>.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Generosity</strong>. <strong>Kindness</strong>. <strong>Empathy</strong>. <strong>Calm</strong>. <strong>Optimism</strong>. <strong>Enthusiasm</strong>. These are all aspects of <strong>Positive Energy</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>If this message makes you feel good—<strong>wonderful</strong>. If not, it may not be your energy, and that’s okay. We want you to feel <strong>good</strong>, <strong>healthy</strong>, and <strong>wealthy</strong>—while <strong>uplifting</strong>, <strong>giving</strong>, and <strong>receiving</strong>.</p>
  
  <p><strong>The Gift of Hope is for you</strong>. It’s an investment in <strong>human connection</strong>. It offers an alternative between <strong>giving</strong> and <strong>receiving</strong>, shared with everyone who dreams of <strong>rising above poverty</strong>.</p>

    <p>This movement ensures the Gift of Hope is not just received—but shared.</p>
   <p class="who-action">
  When you say <strong>“I’m in”</strong>, you’re joining a ripple of generosity that flows <strong>month after month</strong>. Each participant sends a <strong>$20 gift to three people monthly</strong>—a simple act that plants seeds of abundance and connection.
</p>
<p class="who-action">
  This isn’t just giving—it’s <strong>sharing a movement</strong>. Your gift helps others rise, and their gift helps you rise in return. <strong>Everyone receives. Everyone uplifts.</strong>
</p>
<p class="who-action">
  <strong>The Gift of Hope is not a transaction—it’s a transformation.</strong> You’re investing in <strong>human connection</strong>, and your light becomes part of something beautiful.
